# evm-dev-bootcamp

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises completed as part of the [Ethereum Blockchain Developers](https://www.udemy.com/course/blockchain-developer/) course on Udemy. The course was conducted by Ravinder Deol, Thomas Wiesner, and Haseeb Chaudhry and was completed in 2021. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developing various smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Repository Contents

> All dApps feature **testing and deployment setups** using **Truffle** and **Ganache**

- [Contract Fundamentals](/contract-fundamentals/): This directory contains various Solidity contracts demonstrating best practices for writing secure and efficient smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- [Geth Modification](/geth-modification/): Resources related to setting up private blockchain networks using the Go Ethereum (Geth) client.
- [Shared Wallet](/shared-wallet/): Shared wallet project, a decentralized application that enables multiple parties to share funds in a secure manner.
- [Supply Chain](/supply-chain/): Supply Chain Application that demonstrates how blockchain can revolutionize supply management by ensuring transparency and traceability.
- [Token Sale](/token-sale/): Token Sale Application that demonstrates the concept of coin offerings, KYC, and whitelists.
- [Web3 Instance](/web3-instance/): Browser console setup showing how to interact with EVM blockchains using the Web3 instance that can be used within webpages and servers.
- [Web3 Terminal](/web3-terminal/): Scripts designed to run in the terminal for interacting with EVM blockchains and making queries such as getting balances, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.
